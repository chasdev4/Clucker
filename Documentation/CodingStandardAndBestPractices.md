### Naming Conventions

#### File naming conventions

Flutter:

Any files created under a flutter project must use snake-case when naming files. This means all lowercase letter, digits, and underscores are valid.

Good example:
- `signup_form.dart`
- `main_app.dart`

Bad example:
- `SignUpForm.dart`
- `sign-up-form.dart`
- `Sign_Up_From.dart`
